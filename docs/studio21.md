2. A virtual destructor is essential in a polymorphic base class to ensure that resources are released when objects of derived classes go out of scope or are deleted.

3. by using dependency injection, the CommandPrompt becomes a highly flexible and reusable class, 
   capable of working with a variety of file systems, file factories, and commands. 
   This design allows for easy extension and modification of the system it operates within, without requiring changes to the CommandPrompt's code.

4. Quitting the Command Prompt, Asking for General Help, Asking for Help on Touch Command, Executing Touch Command, File Verification, all of them passed.
